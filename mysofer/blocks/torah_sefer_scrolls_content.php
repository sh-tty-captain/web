    <p>The <strong>Sefer Torah</strong> Is The Most Precious Article In Jewish Life. It Is What Conect Us With G-D And It Is
      The Source From Which We Derive Divine Instruction For Our Daily Life. It Is Prefectly Intact Just As We
      Received It Some 3,500 Years Ago.</p>

    <p>In Accordance With Tradition The First Presentation Was Shown To Moshe By G-D "Written In Black Fire
      Over White Fire". Moshe Transcribed From That <strong>Torah</strong> Of Fire While G-D Dictated The Words. This
      Very <strong>Torah</strong> Was Placed In The Holy Ark And Twelve Additional <strong>Torah</strong> Scrolls Were
      Gifted To Each Of The Tribes.</p>

    <p>From These Original Scrolls, Additional <strong>Torahs</strong> Were Transcribed In Precise Detail. Even The
      Letters Were Identical In Appearance. Indeed Each And Every Feature Was Prescribed By G-D. Thus The
      Chain Of <strong>Torah</strong> Remained Unbroken From The Time It Was Given To Us At Sinai.</p>

    <p>Along The 3,516 Years Of Jewish History, No One Of The <strong>Torah's</strong> 304,805 Lleters Has Ever Been
      Changed And A <strong>Sefer Torah</strong> That Exist In New York Is Exactly The Same That Exist In Japan
      . The Words We Read In Synagogue Today Are Exactly Those Recorded By Moses. Our Sages Have Thaught That Every
      Jew Has A Letter In The <strong>Torah</strong> Which Corresponds To His Or Her Soul And Spiritual Identity. Just
      As Each Letter Is An Essential Part Of The <strong>Torah</strong>, So Too Each And Every Jew Is Of Utmost
      Importance And Constitutes An Essential And Integral Part Of K'lal Israel ( Jewish People ).</p>

    <p>The Very Last Mitzvah In The <strong>Torah</strong> Is To Write A <strong>Torah Scroll</strong>. By Endowing A
      Letter, Word, Sentence For Yourself, Your Children, Family Members Or Friends, It Is As If You Have
      Written Your Own <strong>Torah Scroll</strong>.</p>

    <p><strong>Mitzvah On Every Jew</strong></p>

    <p>It Is A Mitzvah(Positive Commandment) For Every Jew To Write For Himself A <strong>Sefer Torah</strong> As It Is
      Said: "And Now Write For You This Song And From Tradition Our Sages Received The Explanation Of This
      Verse: To Write The Whole <strong>Torah</strong> Were The Song Is Written. Even If One Inherited A
      <strong>Sefer Torah</strong> From His Father, Still He Is Commanded To Write One For Himself. If He Hired
      A Sofer(Certified Scribe) To Write A <strong>Sefer Torah</strong> For Him Or If He Fixed The
      <strong>Sefer Torah</strong> Considered As If He Wrote It By Himself.</p>

    <p><strong>Honoring</strong></p>

    <p>We Are Intructed To Render Great Honor To The <strong>Sefer Torah</strong>. And It Is A Mitzvah To Designate For
      The <strong>Sefer Torah</strong> An Specific Place, To Clean This Place A Beautify It As Posible. One Who Sees
      A Person Carring A <strong>Sefer Torah</strong> Needs To Stand Up Before It Until The <strong>Sefer
        Torah</strong> Is Put Back In It Place Or Until He Doesn't See It Anymore. And By The Beit Hakneset
      (Synagogue) When The <strong>Sefer Torah</strong> Is Taken Out And Returned, It Is A Mitzvah For All Those Who
      The <strong>Sefer Torah</strong> Pass By To Go Along With It Until Its Place.</p>
